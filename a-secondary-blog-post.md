# By the user, for the user, to the user

In 2019, clients love authenticity. They love stumbling upon products by accident--indulging inevitably in an act of discovery. But things don’t happen by accident on the internet, at least not always.   


Discovery and to put it precisely, ‘search’ is a web of links branching out of each other. They are always connected and will ultimately get you where you want to be. Search engine optimisation and usage of more visuals is just another way to extend the bandwidth of a product’s reach.   


However, marketers are thinking beyond these successful trends now. They’re looking for more organic options and what is more natural than content which comes straight from the customer?

User generated content comes in many shapes and sizes. The most obvious ones are in the form of reviews and hashtags. In fact user generated content is very closely connected to purpose driven marketing. A customer’s perception of a product inspires the product and brand but is also inevitably influenced by the purpose of the product.   


It is incredibly enjoyable and energizing for clients to be quoted or have substance shared by a brand. Users start to feel like they’re part of something bigger. That when a brand succeeds, they’ve majorly contributed to it--- which is actually quite true. User generated content is the best way to truly engage the customer.   


Curating content  created by the user also means that there’s lesser work on your plate. You don’t have to be wracking your brain everyday to come up with newer ideas. On one hand, not only do users act like a silent support system, they also are the source of many creative inspirations.

**So what truly are the defining perks of user generated content?**  


As mentioned before, there’s generally more engagement between the brand and the customer. Between 2017- 2018, the usage of influencers--who fall somewhat between users and advertisers--- were all the rage. Favourable reviews by them, referrals were the kind of user generated content which drove brands to success. This was a strategy employed by Bira beers when they entered the scene. Dominated by brands such as Kingfisher and Budweiser, Bira’s collection and emphasis on influencers really pushed the envelope.

This kind of content also does wonders when it comes to conversion rates. Take for example e-commerce websites such as flipkart and amazon. The very existence of the ‘cart’ where you can store products to be bought later is a blessing and a curse simultaneously. Many customers will oscillate between decision and indecision and that hampers the growth of many sales. But with user generated content like reviews, and the very system of ‘liking’ something or giving ratings has higher chances of converting the indecision to a decisive purchase. As a matter of fact, over [70% customers](https://consumerist.com/2015/06/03/nearly-70-of-consumers-rely-on-online-reviews-before-making-a-purchase/) surmise that they look at the reviews before making purchases.

In fact, reviews and ratings also go a long way in building the trust. Social media audits to adjudge where you’re at will often go through bulks of user generated content. Not only do they tell you how popular a brand is but also helps keep a good brand image for new customers. Many brands will go all the way and gamify their user generated content. The idea of leaderboards, VIP status when it comes to a brand is to make the brand more interactive and exciting. Businesses usually incentivise their customers to leave ratings and reviews by offering them freebies, cashbacks and much more. When it comes to user generated content----sky really is not the limit. It goes beyond that.
