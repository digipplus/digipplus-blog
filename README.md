# Can your website breathe?

What do you think annoys customers the most when they open a website?

The loading speed—or the lack thereof.   


The customer’s encounter with the brand’s website is crucial for the brand.   


First, there’s plenty of competition around, and no one enjoys waiting.  


Second, a slow website will have already coloured the view of the user.   


Imagine if you had to wait five seconds longer for your Netflix account to open, or for your Amazon search page to load.

How different would your customer experience be than what it is now?  


Safe to say, brands invest heavily on the creation of a fast-paced website.   


Speed is also important because it's one criterion based on which Google ranks a website. Hence, ensuring the amount of content you have on your website, along with how heavy it is makes it super important in creating the reputation of your brand.   


This is where web design comes to the fore.

**Your website needs to breathe.**  


Treat it like an organic homebody who deserves the right kind of nurturing and conditioning to do their work. They need enough input to grow, but also need their space, quite literally. If left unattended for too long, the website will fester as inertia takes over.  


Hence, the website needs to keep moving. It needs to keep evolving.

We had discussed earlier, how important visuals are and so did we discuss the importance of graphics in another blog.   


But what if the graphic you attached hindered with the speed of your website?  


What if your graphic does not bode well with the way you constructed your brand image?  


Here, web design is the bigger picture every brand needs to work with.   


**Why is having an excellent web design important?**  


1. **Optimisation is key, always**

The first inclination is to always optimise the brand’s content. Since search engines often dictate the fate of the brand, businesses spend a lot of their time developing content and design to leverage their website.   


This is also connected to the pace of the website. A well designed website will perform flawlessly on the mobile phone.   


Since most of the transactions have switched to mobile phones in the last ten years, it is more important that your website work better on the phone than on the desktop interface.

   **2.  What does the user see?**  


But let’s talk about the nuances of design. By which we mean the colour and the contrast of your website.  


For example, let’s have a look at how Netflix’s website has been designed.   


Netflix’s background is black. Now black connotes vastness. It forms the perfect plane on which products---in this case, movies can be highlighted. Plus, black has a way of forming the perfect contrast to the colour of its logo, the red.   


Contrast is an important tactic in both web and graphic design. The size of your text, how different it is and how you’ve placed it can make all the difference from pushing your content to the extraordinary from the ordinary.   


**3. Being visual means being visible**  


What’s the mark of great remembrance for a brand? Any guesses?   


Well it’s the logo of course.   


Logos are created to give an identity to the brand. The more creative the logo, the better its chances of being relevant to the user. But one should treat a logo a bit more seriously than that.   


When one sees the bird-shaped logo of twitter or the singular F for Facebook, they automatically know what they’re interacting with. Ideally, it takes close to seven revisions to make things a habit.   


Hence, it is important that logos be utilised as freely as possible. Logos are often used in the way of watermarks attached to photographs. Hence, consistently \(and smartly\) placing your watermarks at different points can make all the difference. 

Wrapping it up, we can say that a website is an important part of your business and it’s important to make it top-notch to break through the noise.  


Eventually, it represents the face of your brand and thus, is a contributing factor in your success.  


All the best!
